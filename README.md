# provider-k3s

`provider-k3s` is a [Crossplane](https://crossplane.io/) Provider that manages
[k3s](https://k3s.io/) clusters on remote hosts via SSH. It allows you to
declaratively install k3s servers, join worker or additional server nodes, and
retrieve kubeconfigs — all through Kubernetes custom resources.

This provider is inspired by [k3sup](https://github.com/alexellis/k3sup) and
uses the same approach of SSH-based k3s installation and cluster joining. While
k3sup is a CLI tool for one-shot operations, provider-k3s brings the same
workflow into the Crossplane reconciliation loop for continuous desired-state
management.

## Features

- Install k3s server on a remote host via SSH
- Join worker (agent) or additional server nodes to an existing cluster
- Retrieve kubeconfig and node-token via Crossplane connection secrets
- Support for TLS SANs, HA with embedded etcd, custom k3s versions/channels
- ProviderConfig with SSH key or password authentication

## Resources

### Cluster-Scoped (`k3s.crossplane.io`)

| Kind | API Group | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| `ProviderConfig` | `k3s.crossplane.io/v1alpha1` | SSH credentials (cluster-scoped) |
| `Cluster` | `k3s.crossplane.io/v1alpha1` | k3s server installation |
| `Node` | `k3s.crossplane.io/v1alpha1` | Join agent/server to cluster |

### Namespaced (`k3s.m.crossplane.io`)

| Kind | API Group | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| `ProviderConfig` | `k3s.m.crossplane.io/v1alpha1` | SSH credentials (namespaced) |
| `ClusterProviderConfig` | `k3s.m.crossplane.io/v1alpha1` | SSH credentials (cluster-wide, for cross-namespace access) |
| `Cluster` | `k3s.m.crossplane.io/v1alpha1` | k3s server installation (namespaced) |
| `Node` | `k3s.m.crossplane.io/v1alpha1` | Join agent/server to cluster (namespaced) |

## Quick Start

### 1. Create SSH credentials

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: ssh-credentials
  namespace: crossplane-system
type: Opaque
stringData:
  ssh-privatekey: |
    -----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
    ...
    -----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
```

### 2. Create a ProviderConfig

```yaml
apiVersion: k3s.crossplane.io/v1alpha1
kind: ProviderConfig
metadata:
  name: ssh-ubuntu
spec:
  username: ubuntu
  credentials:
    source: Secret
    secretRef:
      namespace: crossplane-system
      name: ssh-credentials
      key: ssh-privatekey
```

### 3. Install a k3s Cluster

```yaml
apiVersion: k3s.crossplane.io/v1alpha1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: my-cluster
spec:
  forProvider:
    host: 192.168.1.100
    port: 22
    k3sChannel: stable
    tlsSAN: k3s.example.com
    disableTraefik: true
  providerConfigRef:
    name: ssh-ubuntu
  writeConnectionSecretToRef:
    name: my-cluster-kubeconfig
    namespace: crossplane-system
```

The controller will SSH into the target host, install k3s, and publish the
kubeconfig, endpoint, and node-token to the connection secret.

### 4. Join a Worker Node

```yaml
apiVersion: k3s.crossplane.io/v1alpha1
kind: Node
metadata:
  name: worker-1
spec:
  forProvider:
    host: 192.168.1.101
    port: 22
    clusterRef:
      name: my-cluster
    role: agent
    k3sChannel: stable
  providerConfigRef:
    name: ssh-ubuntu
```

The Node controller resolves the server host and node-token from the referenced
Cluster resource and its connection secret, then SSHs into the worker to run the
k3s join command.

## How It Works

```
ProviderConfig (SSH user + key)
       |
       v
   Cluster CR ──────────────> SSH into server host
   (host, k3s params)         curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -
       |                      ↓
       |                 connection secret:
       |                   - kubeconfig
       |                   - endpoint
       |                   - node-token
       v
    Node CR ──────────────> SSH into worker host
    (host, clusterRef)      K3S_URL=... K3S_TOKEN=... curl ... | sh -
```

Each machine's SSH target (host + port) is specified on the Cluster or Node
resource itself. The ProviderConfig only holds the SSH identity (username +
credentials), so a single ProviderConfig can be reused across multiple machines
that share the same SSH user and key.

## Drift Detection

Every `Cluster` and `Node` accepts an optional `spec.driftDetection` block that
controls how the controller reacts when the live host no longer matches the
resource's desired configuration:

```yaml
apiVersion: k3s.crossplane.io/v1alpha1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: my-cluster
spec:
  driftDetection:
    mode: enabled
    ignore:
      - paths:
          - forProvider.k3sVersion
  forProvider:
    host: 192.168.1.100
    port: 22
    k3sChannel: stable
  providerConfigRef:
    name: ssh-ubuntu
```

`mode` selects the behaviour:

- `enabled` (the default — a resource with no `driftDetection` block behaves
  exactly as if this were set) — detect drift and correct it by re-running the
  install/join command with the resource's declared configuration.
- `warn` — detect drift and report it on the resource's `DriftDetected`
  condition, but do not correct it.
- `disabled` — neither detect nor correct drift.

`ignore` lists `forProvider` fields that are owned by something other than
Crossplane, in Crossplane field path notation (for example
`forProvider.k3sVersion`) or as a JSON Pointer (`/forProvider/k3sVersion`). An
ignored field is seeded from `spec` on create, and from then on the value last
observed on the host is carried forward instead of being overwritten from
`spec`. Fields the SSH target's own identity is derived from (`host`) can
never be ignored.

**How drift is measured on this provider.** The k3s install and join scripts
return no introspectable server configuration — there is nothing to read back
from the host and compare against `spec` directly. Instead, the controller
records the mutable configuration it last sent to the host in an annotation
and compares the resource's current `spec` against that record on every
reconcile. This means drift detection here only catches configuration that
diverged from what Crossplane itself last applied — a change made directly on
the host outside of any k3s reconfiguration this provider performed (for
example editing a systemd unit or a k3s config file by hand) is **not**
detected, because the provider never re-reads the host's actual running
configuration.

## Acknowledgements

This provider is built on top of the patterns established by
[k3sup](https://github.com/alexellis/k3sup) by Alex Ellis. k3sup provides the
foundational approach of installing and joining k3s clusters over SSH, which this
provider adapts into the Crossplane reconciliation model.

## Releases and Support

See [RELEASES.md](RELEASES.md) for the versioning scheme, which releases are
supported, and what changes across an upgrade or a downgrade.

## Verifying this package

Every release publishes an image signature plus a full ladder of OCI 1.1
attestations — two SBOMs, two VEX statements, SLSA provenance, and a
vens risk-scoring context document — using [Sigstore
cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign) keyless signing. There is no key
to manage or rotate: the signing identity is the GitHub Actions OIDC token
for the release workflow run.

**Requires cosign >= 3.0.6.** cosign v3.x attaches
attestations as OCI 1.1 referrers, not the legacy `.sig`/`.att` tag scheme —
`crane ls` on the image shows only the version tag and the digest tag. An
older cosign, and some Kyverno / policy-controller configurations expecting
the legacy tags, report "no signatures found" on an image that is correctly
signed. Install a current cosign before running the commands below.

Every referrer currently carries the same
`dev.sigstore.bundle.predicateType: https://sigstore.dev/cosign/sign/v1`
annotation, including the SBOMs — this is upstream cosign behavior, not
specific to this project, so do not filter referrers on that annotation.
Select the one you want with `--type` on `cosign verify-attestation`, as the
commands below do.

```bash
UP_ORG=crossplane-contrib
GITHUB_ORG=crossplane-contrib
PROJECT_NAME=provider-k3s
VERSION=vX.Y.Z                     # the release you are verifying
ISSUER="https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com"

# The repository segment, unlike the org segment, is a naming rule that
# binds every provider: releases are only ever cut upstream, never from a
# fork, so the repository's name is always ${PROJECT_NAME} -- read from a
# recorded rule, not guessed. The identity also stays pinned to the org,
# the workflow path and the exact tag.
# VERSION is regexp-escaped before interpolation -- an unescaped '.'
# is a wildcard that would let a tag differing from VERSION only at a '.'
# position verify here too.
VERSION_RE="${VERSION//./\\.}"
IDENTITY_REGEXP="^https://github\.com/${GITHUB_ORG}/${PROJECT_NAME}/\.github/workflows/release\.yaml@refs/tags/${VERSION_RE}\$"
IMAGE="xpkg.upbound.io/${UP_ORG}/${PROJECT_NAME}"

DIGEST=$(crane digest "${IMAGE}:${VERSION}")
SUBJECT="${IMAGE}@${DIGEST}"

# Signature
cosign verify \
  --certificate-identity-regexp "$IDENTITY_REGEXP" \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer "$ISSUER" \
  "$SUBJECT"

# SBOMs
cosign verify-attestation --type spdxjson  --certificate-identity-regexp "$IDENTITY_REGEXP" --certificate-oidc-issuer "$ISSUER" "$SUBJECT"
cosign verify-attestation --type cyclonedx --certificate-identity-regexp "$IDENTITY_REGEXP" --certificate-oidc-issuer "$ISSUER" "$SUBJECT"

# VEX
cosign verify-attestation --type openvex                    --certificate-identity-regexp "$IDENTITY_REGEXP" --certificate-oidc-issuer "$ISSUER" "$SUBJECT"
cosign verify-attestation --type https://cyclonedx.org/vex  --certificate-identity-regexp "$IDENTITY_REGEXP" --certificate-oidc-issuer "$ISSUER" "$SUBJECT"

# SLSA provenance
cosign verify-attestation --type slsaprovenance1 --certificate-identity-regexp "$IDENTITY_REGEXP" --certificate-oidc-issuer "$ISSUER" "$SUBJECT"

# vens risk-scoring context
cosign verify-attestation --type https://vens.dev/risk-context/v1 --certificate-identity-regexp "$IDENTITY_REGEXP" --certificate-oidc-issuer "$ISSUER" "$SUBJECT"
```

Or run the whole ladder non-interactively, including the cross-check that
every attestation's subject digest matches what the tag currently resolves
to:

```bash
hack/verify-release.sh vX.Y.Z
```

### SBOM identity

The Go-module SBOM's `metadata.component.name` is this project's module
path, `github.com/crossplane-contrib/provider-k3s`. A module path and the
name of the git repository hosting this project are independent
identifiers, and are allowed to disagree — this is not a substitution or a
mismatch: the module path names who publishes this project, while a
repository name is only a hostname path segment, free to differ from it.
