# token -- the same UP_API_TOKEN / UP_ORG wiring the Upbound configuration
# packages use. Do NOT pass `--create`: it hits the api.upbound.io
# repositories endpoint, and robot tokens 401 there. Registry repositories
# are created out-of-band.
#
# NOTE: the `up login` performed by upbound/action-up is NOT what authenticates
# the push. UP_API_TOKEN is a robot token, and up's RegistryKeychain falls back
# to the Docker keychain for robot tokens ("robot tokens cannot be used for
# registry login 401 Unauthorized"), so CI must additionally `docker login`
